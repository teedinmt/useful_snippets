//using the variable values of 'lastname' and 'firstname' taken in from the user,
//and a created date variable 'enrollmentdate'.

 //set up the name as a string with underscores between the values
       String filenamed = lastname + "_" + firstname + "_" + enrollmentdate;
 //now use the string when setting the file name
       clientreport.save("c://savedfiles//filenamed" + filenamed + ".pdf");
       clientreport.close();
